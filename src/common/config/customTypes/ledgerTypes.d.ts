/**
 * TODO: Ledger types are not being resolved correctly.
 *   1. The package has an incorrect build output structure with a nested package.json
 *   in the lib/esm directory that's causing module resolution issues
 *   2. The nested package.json contains workspace references and incorrect export paths
 *   3. The build process needs to be fixed to:
 *     - Not copy the package.json into the build output
 *     - Properly structure the built files without nested package.json files
 *     - Ensure type declarations are properly referenced
 *     - Fix the export paths in the main package.json
 * As a temporary workaround, fixing the types manually here.
